        <p class="lead mb-4"> I am currently 19 years old therefore my job experience is not that high. I’ve had about two jobs and I have learned a lot from them despite being so young. 

The first job I’ve ever had was at McDonald’s.  I was in charge of making the fries and handing out orders to the customers. The one thing that this job really taught me Was how to deal with people. It did not take me long to realize that in society today some people can be rude. The location that I had worked at was not in the best area and we were constantly getting people coming in who were intoxicated and or were in a bad state of mind. I worked there for two years and it really made me a tough person. Some of the customers would be very hard to deal with however I always made it work.

 I know another thing that I have gained from working at McDonald’s is my time management skills. Before I was employed there I never had to check my schedule or because she’s on time, I would always just live life by the hour. McDonald’s introduced structure into my life which made me realize how important it is to be on top of time. Since I worked there for a while I became very good at not being late and always showing up on time. Now I can say that I am rarely late and I usually am very good at managing when I need to be somewhere. This is helped me a lot in my real life because everything is on the schedule these days. Now I can confidently say that I am ready to responsibly tackle my duties and stay on top of what needs to be done.

My newest job is actually at my school working in the dining hall. We serve about 2000 people a day so it gets very busy. One thing that this job has taught me and is currently still teaching me is how to work effectively with a team. Since we are always jam packed we need to be on top of our game at all times. It gets very hard especially during long shifts to stay on top of your work, so help is always needed. One thing that we powder cell phones at work is being able to always help each other. The staff has definitely taught me how to be a good coworker and to always look out for my fellow employees. I am very thankful for this because working here has open my eyes completely. It is so nice to work with people especially when you’re working towards a common goal. Working at this dining hall has made me enjoy collaborating with others and achieving goals. 

I can say that through my years of working in dining I have developed an immense amount of patients and willpower. I am thankful that God has let me experience the things I have because it has made me a better person. Sometimes working in the food industry can be a little hard, however there are many positives to it as well. My work experience has gone through the roof Solely because I have been put in many tough situations.
